## âœ¨ Adding a New Agent

This is the most common way to contribute! Hereâ€™s how you can add your own sub-agent to the system.

1.  **Create a feature branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat-agent-<feature-name>
    ```
2.  **Copy and modify a sub-agent:** Duplicate the `google_search_dummy_agent` directory in `agent-app/app/sub_agents/`.  Modify the files within the new directory to build your sub-agent.
3.  **Register your sub-agent:**
    - Edit `/Users/arjunvijay/Documents/my-projects/reusable-asset/jarvis/delivery-app-mod-agent/agent-app/app/prompt.py` to add a prompt.
    - Edit `/Users/arjunvijay/Documents/my-projects/reusable-asset/jarvis/delivery-app-mod-agent/agent-app/app/agent.py` to import your sub-agent and include it in the `tools` list within the `root_agent` definition:

```python
      root_agent = LlmAgent(
            name="jarvis_coordinator",
            model=MODEL,
                AgentTool(agent=google_search_dummy_agent),
            ],
        ) 
```
4.  **Documentation:**  Ensure that each method has a proper docstring and follows the project structure.  Also, make sure to add `__init__.py` file in your agent directory.
5.  **Test your changes:**
    1.  Run the following command locally and test your changes for new sub agent by prompting
    ```bash
    make dev
    ```
6.  **Submit a pull request:**  Create a PR and request a review from `@arjunvijaygoogle`. Include screenshots of your local testing in the PR description.
