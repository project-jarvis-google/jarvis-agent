# Database Overview & Workload
- Current database technology, version, and edition (e.g., Oracle 19c Enterprise)
- Primary workload type (OLTP, OLAP, or HTAP)
- Total size of the database and its projected growth rate
- Current hosting platform (e.g., on-premises, private cloud, other public cloud)
- The number and complexity of schemas, tables, views, and indexes
- The nature and volume of large objects (LOBs, BLOBs, etc.) stored in the database

# Performance & Scalability
- Known performance bottlenecks and peak load times
- Average and peak transaction volumes and concurrent user counts
- Current read/write ratio for the primary workload
- Existing database scaling strategy (vertical vs. horizontal)
- Key performance metrics and any existing performance benchmarking reports
- Details on connection pooling mechanisms currently in use

# High Availability & Disaster Recovery
- Current Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirements
- The existing High Availability (HA) setup (e.g., clustering, replication, Oracle RAC)
- The current Disaster Recovery (DR) strategy and the date it was last tested
- Requirements for cross-regional replication for DR or data locality

# Security & Compliance
- Data encryption methods for data at rest and in transit
- The current strategy for managing user authentication and authorization
- Use of specific security features like Virtual Private Database (VPD) or Row-Level Security
- Any specific compliance or data residency requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that dictate where data must be stored
- Current auditing and logging mechanisms for database activity
- The presence of any sensitive data (e.g., PII, financial data) that requires special handling
- Requirements for fine-grained access control
- Use of dedicated key management, such as CMEK, for encryption keys

# Data Migration
- The business tolerance and acceptable window for downtime during the final cutover
- The strategy for data validation and integrity checks post-migration
- The number and nature of applications that depend on the current database
- Compatibility of schema, data types, and proprietary functions with potential target databases
- The complexity of embedded SQL and proprietary code (e.g., PL/SQL) within applications

# Backup & Recovery
- The current database backup and recovery strategy and tools
- Location and type of backup storage (e.g., local disk, NAS, tape, cloud)

# Monitoring & Operations
- Current tools and processes for monitoring database health and performance
- The current patching and maintenance schedule and process

# Cost & Licensing
- The current annual costs for database licensing, support, and hardware maintenance
- The desired future cost model (e.g., pay-as-you-go, subscription)

# Oracle Specific Details
- The use of Oracle-specific features like RAC, Data Guard, GoldenGate, or advanced compression
- The extent to which PL/SQL, stored procedures, triggers, and packages are used
- The use of partitioning strategies for large tables
- The storage management method (e.g., ASM vs. standard file systems like ext4, NTFS)
